## How to use this repo
To use this repos please click the branches tab and each branch stores it's own project!
> [!NOTE]
> I know this breaks normal convention but it's a slightly less cursed then having a folder for each project under main, due to taking up more space on a contributers device by allowing them to only clone one branch instead of every project.
